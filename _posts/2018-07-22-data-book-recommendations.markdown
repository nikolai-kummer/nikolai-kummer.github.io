Good data books are hard to find. Here is a list of recommendations for some great data books that I have enjoyed and found to be very thoughtful. I find these books a great way to entertain yourself, while at the same time learn something along the way:

 [Everybody Lies: Big Data, New Data, and What the Internet Can Tell Us About Who We Really Are](https://www.amazon.com/Everybody-Lies-Internet-About-Really/dp/0062390856/)

 This is a good book about a gentle introduction into the world of big data. Written by Seth Stephens-Davidowitz, a Harvard-trained economist and former Google data scientist he provides a layman-introduction about how to think about data. The author dives deep into how online behaviour can be used to make conclusions about larger populations. This is not a technical book, but an entertaing data read

 [How Not to Be Wrong: The Power of Mathematical Thinking](https://www.amazon.com/How-Not-Be-Wrong-Mathematical/dp/0143127535)

This book is advertised as one of Bill Gates's "10 favourite books" and I did enjoy reading it as well (this is more of a statement about book quality, than my own book taste). The author explains a lot of mathematical concepts with easy to understand use cases and anecdotes. This is the kind of book that you could recommend to someone who might not have a heavy mathematical background and they will still understand it.

 [Weapons of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens Democracy](https://www.amazon.com/Weapons-Math-Destruction-Increases-Inequality/dp/0553418831)

This book is really famous among data scientists and made Cathy O'Neill a household name. It presents numerous example how blind trust into models leads to an overall worse outcome for marginalized groups. I have often encountered blind faith into models in my career and this book reminds you to question the outcomes and the assumptions that went into the development. Examples from Cathy O'Neills book are often quoted when people discuss the ethical obligations of data scientists.

 [Superforecasting: The Art and Science of Prediction](https://www.amazon.com/Superforecasting-Science-Prediction-Philip-Tetlock/dp/0804136718/)

I loved this book! Philip E. Tetlock and Dan Gardner present their research into what makes people better predictors of the future. They turn people into prediction models by teaching them the tools to think about the future and make them better estimators of events. They lead the [Good Judgement project](https://goodjudgment.com/) project where anyone can sign up and make long term predictions about the future. This jives well with my past research into ensemble systems, since a combination of 100s of predictions tends to be more accurate than a single strong predictor. My personal favourite takeaway from this book is to always start with the base rate for an event. The base rate applies to any event whether you are trying to predict whether a married couple will stay together (average population divorce rate), whether the CO2 levels will rise next month (by examining historical data), or the likelyhood of getting mugged in a certain part of town (crime statistics). Additional factor can then move the prediction one way or another once the base rate is defined.

All of these are excellent books that and deal with data science topics without going into the mathematical  
concepts (too deep), which makes them great bedtime reading. That does however not diminish their value since sometimes we have to zoom out and think of the larger picture before we dig in and apply statistical models.
